    <h1> MY AKIRACHIX EXPERIENCE </h1>
    <p style="color: black;" >I am three weeks at AkiraChix. The program is thrilling. The environment is captivating. I love the schedules,classrooms, rooms and the rest of the other students.I am currently enjoying the group assignments in each of the classes. It's been engaging and fun to collaborate with my peers, exploring our creativity and teamwork skills. I'm looking forward to presenting it and receiving feedback, which I believe will help me grow both academically and personally.</p>
